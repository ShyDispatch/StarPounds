# StarPounds

A mod for Starbound that adds body shapes of various sizes and weight gain. Watch your belly swell as you eat, food or others, or subject the npcs of the various worlds to it instead.

StarPounds is designed to mesh with (and ideally enhance) the existing Starbound gameplay loop.


## Features

- Weight gain, and a whole suite of fat-based mechanics.
- Two brand new species, Throgs and Mootants.
- Hundreds of new objects, including weight scales, treadmills, feeding tubes, interactables, giant foods, and both functional and purely decorative objects.
- Innumerable new fattening foods and other consumables.
- Several new fat themed weapons, tools, and traps.
- Three new Throg/Fat themed techs, one for each slot.
- Plenty of new tiles and liquids.
- Separate fat-themed hub for mod content.
- Brand new USCM-themed intro mission for Mootants, including an alternative to the Broken/Protector's Broadsword.
- New Floran gluttonist dungeon, with more dungeons planned in the future.
- Fully fledged skill system for upgrading fat-based attributes & abilities.
- Accessories that boost fat-based attributes.
- Multiple milk-based skills and mechanics.
- Full featured vore mechanics, with both prey and pred functionality.
- Options to enable or disable features of the mod.
- Full compability for multiple modded species.


## Installation

Installation is the same as any other Starbound mod. Simply extract the .pak files from the mod archive directly into your `/Starbound/mods` folder. __Do not put the entire ZIP file into the mods folder.__

The `/mods` directory should look like the following:
```
mods_go_here
StardustLite.pak
Starpounds.pak
Starpounds-ExtendedRaces.pak
Starpounds-Throgverse.pak
...
```
If you have `QuickBarMini` or `Stardust Core` installed either within your mods folder or on the steam workshop. Remove them so they do not conflict with `StardustLite` which is essential.

## FAQ

#### How do I enable the mod?

Assuming you've installed Stardust Core Lite correctly (Bundled in the mod archive, but you can also download it from the either the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2512589532) or [GitHub](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/sb.StardustSuite)), you should have a menu icon to access the QuickBar in the right sidebar (â˜°). Click the StarPounds button to bring up the mod's quick menu, and click the green button at the bottom to toggle the mod.

#### How do I unlock skills?

You can unlock skills at an [Infusion Table](#how-do-i-get-an-infusion-table) using [Experience](#how-do-i-get-experience).

You can also access the skill menu from the QuickBar at any time, however you won't be able to unlock skills ones without an [Infusion Table](#how-do-i-get-an-infusion-table).

#### How do I get Experience?

Experience is gained by eating. The amount gained is directly correlated to how much food an item provides, multiplied by its rarity:
| Rarity    | Multiplier |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| Common    | 1x         |
| Uncommon  | 1.25x      |
| Rare      | 1.5x       |
| Legendary | 1.75x      |
| Essential | 2x         |

Your progress to the next level can be seen in the Skills menu. Each additional level takes more Experience than the last, so it's recommended you spend your levels instead of accumulating large amounts.

#### How do I get an Infusion Table?

You can craft an Infusion Table at the [Inventor's Table](https://starbounder.org/Inventor%27s_Table).

#### How do I get Accessories?

Accessories are found as random loot, and themed accessories have a higher chance to spawn in some of the mod's dungeons. You can also purchase jewellery boxes from random Throg merchants you encounter.
