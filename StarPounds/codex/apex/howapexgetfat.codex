    "Perhaps you, a citizen of Big Ape, visiting neighboring cities to explore all that Big Ape has to offer, came across a new sight that leaves you confused. Towns with the population evidently packing on pounds. Perhaps too many. But you should know that this is perfectly natural. ",

"The Miniknog are bastions of science always seeking to improve the way of life for Apex kind. One brilliant branch has been looking into expanding the peak of bananas. Improving the taste, size, health value, and benefiting Apex as a whole.",

"When regularly eating these super bananas, the Miniknog has found that Apex gain strength without worrying about exercising. Hair becomes silky smooth. And age expectancy increasing by thirty percent. They're so good towns being allowed to have these super bananas just want to eat them all the time.",

"If you see the wobble of a belly so large it could crush a couch, do not worry. That is merely a citizen so in love with these bananas they purposefully ate so much to get this fat by their own choice. Concerns that the bananas are highly fattening, or increase appetite, or can cause addiction from taste, were all disproven in many tests.",

"It is important to remember this, and to not shame any citizen who is eager to enjoy these superior bananas. Growing fat was their choice. And soon, these super bananas will be coming to every other town, including your own. Try to be patient until these delicious bananas can reach your lips. "
