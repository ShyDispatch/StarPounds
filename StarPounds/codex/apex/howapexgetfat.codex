    "When the Miniknog introduced the Vestigi-Evo process to cure the widespread deadly waterborne pathogen that almost wiped out their species. The VEP changed Apex forever. Devolving their physical appearance with the tradeoff of massively increasing their mental capabilities.

As they regressed physically, they took on the traits of their ancestors. Their bodies bulked up with added muscle, their strength more naturally impressive.",

"Yet while their standard of beauty is a common discussed source of negatives with their transformation. Their change in diet is not one usually addressed. To maintain their new stature, Apex now require a substantial amount of food to sustain themselves.

From a change in their nutrional needs, to even how much more they have to eat, their body is much more high maintenance. Making it much easier for Apex to gain additional weight."
