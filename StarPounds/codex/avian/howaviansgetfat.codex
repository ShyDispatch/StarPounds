    "Avians aren't known for having an obesity problem. But that does not exclude Avians from becoming overweight. Overeating and lack of exercise can still persist even in their perfect society.

Especially with their love of baked goods and pastries, a market in abundance in Avian society. Mixed with the usual luxury upper class Avians can enjoy, and it's not hard to find plumper birds among the rich.",

"While this tidbit is meaningless given the subject matter. Avians chosen as Ascendants enjoy a brief time of luxury before their leap of faith to join Kluex in heaven. Where they can truly feel like a god that they're promised they'll become.

One such luxury is the nine days of feasting they gorge themselves on. Such heavy feasting has made a notable statisic that many Ascendants gain noticeable weight for their fated day. With speculation such weight prevents them from spreading their spritual wings."
