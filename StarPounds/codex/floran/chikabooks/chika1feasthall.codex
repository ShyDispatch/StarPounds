"Bwugh. Still not over the fact the Greenfinger kicked me out- like, yeah Abiba and Shabi said I stole from their shops... multiple times.

Granted the other Floran don't really like me- \"Too scrawny\" they said, \"bad aim\" maybe if you let me keep those glasses I'd be doing better! (even if those were stolen too)",

"So been hitchhiking the last while- got lucky enough to tag along with some foreign Floran who were stopping by! Apparantly they're from the Gluttonist tribes- looking at their waistlines told me as much.

One had tree trunks for legs, one's belly was bigger than I was! They're being chill with me though so I shouldn't have to worry about much... at least hopefully.",

"The bigger one let me nap on their belly while the thick one was flying the ship over to their home village. Won't lie, it was very comfy- practically sank into their chub and it was *so* soft~

Didn't even realized I fell asleep until round one shook me awake, and I (unfortunately) had to hop down to the floor and follow them for housing.", 

"After we left the ship we had to walk through the chilly snow for quite a while- the other two seemed fairly warm in comparison (probably cuz of their blubber) but I was freezing the entire walk until we reached their lair.

It was... that weird mix of humble and boastful- statues of big fattie Floran stood besides the entrance made of green bricks, built into the side of the mountain.",

"As we climbed down the stairway I was met with a bustling hall full of Floran of different widths and the faint scent of freshly cooked meats wafted through the hall. I saw Florans lining up to chug honey out of large tanks, large walk-in cookers lined with delicious looking meats...

Almost lapsed back into my more primal instincts. Just wanna scarf it all down~",

"Soon I was brought face to face with the... Greenfinger? Honestly didn't even realize I was looking at a Floran until they rose up, being a mountain of jiggly fat in comparison to me. They asked me if I wanted to join their tribe, and I decided to agree. I couldn't help but notice the giant three-pronged spear they had.

Wasn't long until they pointed to a room behind themself and the other two following me led me in.",

"It was lousy with bright pink lights growing from the floor and ceiling, and at one end was a giant flower, growing these big red berries. Apparantly these are \"meatberries\", which have a weird ability to make meat-stuffs for others to eat.

Apparantly only the Champion is allowed to have it. That sounds like a challenge~",

"But that had to wait 'till everyone here's asleep if I wanna \"borrow\" those berries. I was brought over to a big room lined with tables, covered with plates full of delicious looking meats and soups~ Didn't take long for me to scarf down all the meats- even slurped down an entire thing of sausages. My belly growls just thinking of it even though its still stuffed out a good foot out from dinner~

Eventually night came, and with it my chance.",

"While my stuffed belly did get in my way a few times I managed to quietly walk into the halls and snuck into the champion's room. Unsurprisingly, they were still there, out like a log. I could hear their belly still gworgling with all the food they must've stuffed themself with. As quietly as I could I snuck around them, gently opening the door as I walked into the garden behind them.

There it was, all within my reach~ Those berries will be mine~",

"I got a good feel of them- while their surface was smooth like most berries, it had a very meaty... squishyness to it. Wasn't long until I stuffed two of them into my thermos, perfectly hidden inside. \"That was easy.\" I thought as I was walking out, managing to go in and out without any problems!

And then I heard a crunch beneath my feet. I wasn't watching where I was stepping and stepped on some dry leaves coating the floor.",

"I tried to sneak out, hoping no one noticed, and then I saw the Champion staring me in the face, staring down at me from over a tower of lard.

Needless to say, they weren't happy. I had to duck and weave past thrusts of the giant spear as I bolted for the door. At least they couldn't chase me.

But then they started banging the pots around the room together and alerted the rest of the hall.",

"I was practically running on adrenaline at that point, rushing out of the lair trying not to get hit with swords and spears and needles. A few Floran were able to get lucky shots on my butt and I could feel my belly swell with... something. I heard them shouting at me, threatening to make me into the Champion's dinner. Thankfully I managed to rush up the stairs, and ran into the snowy wilderness, a little winded.

At least I got something special out of it!",

"Right now I'm hiding out a cave, able to somehow make a fire as I tried to make myself warm. At least the meatberries are safe in the thermos, but that kinda bit me in my fat ass.

Might have to rough it out for a bit, if I'm lucky I could hitchhike elsewhere.

PS. Noticed my butt feels softer now. Think I might've gained some weight from that venture!"
