"Perhaps it was a bit of a mistake to piss off the Gluttonists like that. Illgotten berries aside, I miiiiight have screwed myself over.

I'm not much of a winter plant as it turns out- I've been freezing my fat tits off in the cold trying to find someway off this snowy rock, with very little luck. Mostly just abandoned houses and ruins, not much in the ways of, yanno, actual shelter out here.",

"Yet, like someone was listening, I found something; a massive Glitch Fortress! Though it looks quite different from how I've heard Glitch castles described before- being made of brown stone and covered in pink shingles.

Either way, anything was better than becoming a plantcicle out there, so I went into the castle through a pair of giant doors (that seemed to have been activated by a nearby orb-switch-thing).",

"It was pretty dark inside- though it definitely felt lived in. Not a cobweb or speck of grime to be seen anywhere inside. The doors definitely seemed to have been designed for... Plus-sized figures so to speak as well.

Couldn't recognize any of the things on the pink banners, but I did see some decorative armors that seemed to be just as fat as the average Glitch here. Found some weird barrels that felt cold, helped myself to some of their mead.",

"As I went deeper, I saw strange jars and bottles hanging from the ceiling and rafters. I swore I saw small dancing lights inside them, constantly swirling around inside.

And suddenly I saw a larger orb of light pass the corner. I noticed it was wearing one of those little wizard hats and was holding some kinda wood cane!

It quickly noticed me too.",

"I was worried it was going to try to kill me- that's generally what'd happen in this situation- but instead it offered me a hand, pointing deeper into the structure with its staff.

I took it up in this offer (though in hindsight maybe that was a bad idea), and it led through winding hallways. As we went down, we passed by more light-ball-critters, some wearing little cloaks and hoods, others wearing bandit clothes and others wearing armor.",

"Up and up we went until I was faced with a giant door, my new friend gesturing me in. I saw a towering... quite busty... woman made of the same orange light. She explained she's a Lipomancer Wisp and that I'm in the domain of the \"Ponderous Order\". Never heard of them.

She offered me room and board until I can leave on my own, and I took her up. She seemed pretty happy, wrapping me in a hug. She felt warm, pleasantly so~ Though I felt a little softer...",

"We helped ourselves to a feast- I stuffed myself with all the sweet rolls and roasted hogs, chugged all the tasty soup, and helped myself to even more mead... Holy hell my belly was stretched so far out~ I could barely stand up after it.

She insisted in giving me a little more, handing me a chalice full of some glowing amber liquid. Caving into my hunger (since that's what my belly does best), I drank the entire cup.",

"I felt much softer... Much much better... I know I was planning on staying here overnight, but maybe I could stick around a little longer...

I decided to lay down on the bed, sleeping soundly through the night...",

"Holy hell what happened the last few days? I just suddenly snapped into it. How long had my arm been glowing? How long have I felt this light and airy? I burst into the Lipomancer's room, wanting answers.

She didn't seem to like that, launching a fireball that threw me to the other side of the room. She told me I should stay, it's nice in here. Bad out there... It sounded tempting but I'd prefer to make my own mistakes.",

"I rushed into the nearest room, blockading the door behind me. It was Full of empty outfits of all sorts of races... And a strange pedestal with a glowing idol. I could feel a strange chill as I swiped it off the altar, though it seems I found myself in a dead end.

With not much else of a choice, I burst through the door, enduring the scorches of the Lipomancer's bolts and the wisps' assault as I ran through the entire castle back out into the snowy wilderness.",

"So I'm back where I started; freezing cold outside, in the middle of nowhere. Only now I have some stolen idol and a glowing arm to count for it. Little fatter too, but that's the least worst thing that could have happened.

The Idol feels pretty warm at least. I could huddle with it... Hopefully it doesn't continue my \"Wispification\".

PS. Still got some leftover mead too! :D"
