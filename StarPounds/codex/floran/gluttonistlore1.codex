"Gluttonists pride ourselves on our eating and weight. Hunt to eat, eat to become bigger. Bigger means more power. And repeat.

Our tribe thanks the Meatberries for their gifts, to help with getting bigger. Our tribe's special treasure.",
  
"Story goes that founder of Gluttonist tribe and their kin were forced to find new hunting ground. They were starved and hungry, unable to catch meats because of being bad hunters. But on Carnos III they found strange plant.

They called it Meatberries, for their red, meatslike berries. These strange fruits had a special power: to generate meats!",
  
"Any kind of meats- from Poptop tenderloin to fish, from bacon to even fishman meat! Gluttonist Greenfinger decided to use plant to help feed tribe and give tribe motivation to train in hunting.

Gluttonists didn't need to worry about food, but still hungered for more. As years went by tribe became larger and wider, eating more and more!",
  
"Eventually Greenfinger decided that Meatberry was privillege, only for the elite hunters. Hunters good enough they didn't even need to cook or kill food- using special weapons they were able to eat prey as fresh as possible.

Greatfork hunters eventually learned to combine the Meatberries with their spears to show position, alongside weight. Only the fattest members of Gluttonist tribe can have Greatforks!",
  
"Now Gluttonists are masters of eating and hunting. Seeking biggerer and fatterer hunters for their ranks- those who do not are eated.

Only the biggest, baddest hunter can reign at the top."
