"Day 5, gained 50 Lbs since start.

Floran still is trying to find best gaining food, other Gluttonists seem to think floran is beneath them. They'll see!!

Maybe floran should go foraging tonite. See if floran can find fruits and berries to help with gaining.",

"Day 8, gained 57 Lbs since start.

Tummy still growling. Floran still struggling to gain- all other Gluttonists get big stuff before I do. Saw Ixoling roast, Maka ate it in one bite with greatfork. Sad.

Foraging from few days ago did help- avesmingo makes food taste nicer. So floran has that going for them",

"Day 10, gained 80 Lbs since start.

Gaining starting to speed up! Floran got a couple smoglins- tasted like those rubber things those human metal things have, but more fattening than expected.

Bigger Gluttonists still not giving me respect- Amibaba called me stringbean. Not floran's fault you beat floran to all the food!",

"Day 12, gained 130 Lbs since start.

Champ Sikka showed up today. They were carried in and all the other hunters looked at them. Floran wishes they can be as big! Sikka has Greatfork with red berries on it.

Floran got lucky- managed to snag three roast poptops for self. Ate faster than usual, face still covered in sauces. Tasty! Belly still gworgling too!",

"Day 15, gained 164 lbs.

Floran managed to stuff self with entire line of sausages. Very tasty. Belly big and full, very gworgly gworgly! Apparantly Floran is about to be assigned hunting detail with Maka. Greenfinger should know Floran not like Maka. Maka rude. Think that having 200 pounds on me makes them better.

We be hunting for next few days, better come back with lots of food. Floran gonna rough it out in the forest!",

"Day 16, don't know gains, feel little heavier.

First day of hunting and foraging. Maka and floran have been very productive... well, floran has. Maka is lousy hunter AND forager. Lazy, sits around. Doesn't even try to help.

At least Floran managed to fill up cart decent amount. Lots of meats and fruits- including lots of avesmingo. Floran did help self to some of the foods. Floran will get bigger any way floran can!",

"Day 17, certainly heavier!

Floran got fed up. Maka lazy and rude, wasting floran's time. Tummy got growly again. So floran had idea... Floran snuck up on Maka while they napped, and shoved his face into mouth!

Floran didn't know could do that! Maka woke up as floran gulped them down- their flailing didn't help! Floran scarfed them down!",

"Floran did almost choke on Maka's fat butt but was able to get it down! As lousy of hunter Maka is, they are tasty! Felt really good coming down throat. Am satisfied watching and feeling them struggle in belly.

It occurs to Floran not think this through. Belly full of Maka heavy. Too heavy to walk. Belly's making noises- gworgle! Glorp! Gurrrgle! Maka will make better food than hunter! Floran will sleep Maka off. Them struggling inside there is like massage~",

"Day 18, Maka made very heavy!

Woke up to smoothed belly. No movement inside- Maka's been digested, good riddance! Floran felt bit of pressure in throat as waking up- let out big \"BWOOORP!\" and saw Maka's loin cloth fly out of mouth.

Got up and felt body over. Definitely gotten fatter- butt especially. Gonna resume foraging and hunting- not want to come home to village empty handed!",

"Day 19, finally measured and have gained 446 lbs!!!

Home at last! Brought cart with about 100 lbs of food- meats, fruits, even some spices for meatdressers and cooks! Greenfinger quickly noticed Maka's absence- Floran said Maka tried to attack me so I eated him. Other florans were staring at butt and belly, Floran can see envy in their eyes!

Floran still has appetite- big feast tomorrow so Floran gets to stuff self~"
