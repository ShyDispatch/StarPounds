    "To those unfamiliar with Glitch, and that's incredibly common due to complications in how Glitch are assembled, it's easy to think it's weird that Glitch are capable of packing on weight. They are just robots after all, right?

While true, Glitch are a bit more advanced in their design. With their primary function and directive being to simulate an evolving civilization, they can simulate a living organism in multiple ways. Such as needing air to breath, food and drink to survive, and storing fat.",

"Why Glitch are designed in such a way goes beyond the simple answer of simulating life but also gives them a means to be self sustainable and last forever. With artificial fat acting as reserve energy for them.

Though it does also lean into the roles of their simulation as well. As notable Glitch that would end up gaining weight would be those that are of more noble blood, or noble oil.",

"From Kings and Queens, to princes and princess', to dukes and duchess'. Even the lower end of nobility, all are capable of enjoying luxury those of a lower class aren't able to. They may even unconsciously lean into gaining weight.

As a part of their protocols, Glitch still under control of their protocols do not have free will like those free of their programming. And fat, pompous nobility indulging in their gluttony adds to the role they are forced to play."
