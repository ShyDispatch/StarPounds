"The pages of history are oft written in the oil of those who came before; from tyrants to beloved kings, vicious blackguards to heroic knights. Oilshed and war are what defines much of Glitch history, with petty squables over lands spiraling out into times of great strife.

But some desire to maintain the peace. Of bringing prosperity to all Glitchkind. That is the singular goal of our order.",

"Our story begins in the quaint land of Zincshire, a fertile land of mills and farmland. An all too quiet place, if not for the Rolwyrm's rampage.

It was a fearsome beast, a four legged serpent made of a substance with a doughy consistency. It devoured Zincshire's crops, destroyed its mills, and wrought great terror to the land. It seemed invincible, each attack merely bouncing off its squishy hide.",

"Indeed, the Rolwyrm seemed unstoppable as a threat, but a fateful encounter would spell its end.

From one land, came a mighty knightess clad in bronze and brass armor. Ironlace, who could swing a four stone hammer as one would a feather, who could wrestle the most fearsome of poptops.

From another, came a mysterious witch: Bronzefinger, who wielded the power of Lipomancy. The art of drawing magic from one's body.",

"Ironlace tried to slay the beast, but to no avail. Despite her superglitchian strength, her hammer couldn't hurt it no matter how hard she attempted to swing. Narrowly escaping being devoured by the doughy dragon, the towering knightess had to reevaluate her plans to defeat it. As she rested at the tavern, she noticed another glitchette enter the building.",

"As chance would have it, Bronzefinger tried earlier that day to slay the Rolwyrm too, though her lipic bolts did no harm either- merely bouncing off its jiggling body.

The two soon spoke of how to defeat it. Ironlace figured that their skills combined could slay the wyrm, which Bronzefinger agreed to help.",

"Soon the fateful day came, and a fierce battle ensued as the two cornered the Rolwyrm. Ironlace swung her hammer with all her might, while Bronzefinger weaved her lipic magic to enhance the knightess's strength.

Yet the beast remained unharmed, even as Ironlace threw all she had at the loathesome drake.

But soon she heard a growl come from her belly. Bronzefinger's eyes lit up, realizing the key to defeating the Rolwyrm.",

"\"Ironlace!\" the witch called out. \"Prepare your stomach!\"

The knightess looked back confused, seeing the witch poising her staff high into the air. A warm light enveloped Ironlace, and her already hungry body suddenly began craving more.

And the Rolwyrm was looking quite satiating.",

"The beast lunged, attempting to swallow the mighty Ironlance. But she caught its jaws, and her eyes had an unmistakable glow of hunger.

Much to the shock and astonishment of all present, her mouthplate opened wide as she mercilessly devoured the Rolwyrm. Inch upon inch of its doughy body slipped down her throat and bulged out her midsection. The gulps could be heard for miles around as the knightess tested her armor's resiliance.",

"Soon the wyrm was devoured, stewing away in the knightess' belly as she collapsed, weighed down by her hefty gut. The overstuffed chamber growled and gurgled as the Rolwyrm squirmed and writhed. Rolled into town, the two declared victory over the wyrm as it was gradually digested by the ravenous Ironlace.

The two were honored as heroes were to be honored, Bronzefinger aiding her newfound companion in processing her meal.",

"Days passed before Ironlace could walk; the Wyrm had its revenge as the knightess swelled up a few sizes. Her metallic body became quite plump, much to Bronzefinger's flustered awe.

Bronzefinger quickly took the oppurtunity to ask if she could join Ironlace, newly christened the Ponderous, in future adventures. The knightess agreed as the two set out to wander the countryside, in search of taleworthy deeds."
