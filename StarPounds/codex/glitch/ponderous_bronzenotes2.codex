"With a good night's sleep (and a belly full of food!), I have been revitalized into picking up my research with the Amberflame.

Though for a good bit I haven't really found much. It's waterproof and doesn't burn like flame so I suppose it could be useful as a light source. Could also be useful as a heatsource in particularly brutal winters. Might be worthwhile to mix with other substances?",

"I found that when distilled in the retorts it winds up being more volatile- burning with a more ferocious heat. Just holding the bottle made me feel heavier and plumper... These I suppose could be useful as a non-lethal weapon? I'll leave it on the other counter for now, beside the Calorium bottles.

Going to try seeing if it'll result in anything strange if I mix it with other substances- so far nothing too strange trying to mix it with water or healing water.",

"I am close to finding something of note, with a spell I managed to make it congeal into a distinct shape, though admittedly I am getting frustrated with the lack of meaningful progress.

And it seems Ironlace noticed, as I heard her approaching the door. She offered to take me to a banquet to let myself have a break from the experimentation. Suppose I could do with that break, so put the current trial with the other bottles.",

"She did come over to check on what I was making, though I don't think she retained much information- admittedly I have a bad habit of overloading her. She walked on her way out and accidentally bumped the counter with her mighty rear. I panicked, realizing my samples might have been destroyed!

And just like that a blast of amber smoke covered the room...",

"As the clouds cleared I checked if Lacie was alright- she was fine, just a bit of growth from being exposed to the lipic mist.

But much to my astonishment something wondrous has happened. Turned out the magicked amberflame, when mixed with the calorium and volatile amberflame, created something. A creature! A dancing mote of light emanating the Amberflame flew across the room.",

"I managed to lure it into a jar before it could knock anything over. This creature reminded me of the tales of the Will O' the Wisps, so I dubbed it a wisp and renamed the Amberflame to Wispflame.

It seemed to dance and bounce around its glass home, though it seemed like it was lacking in intelligence. Perhaps this might be worth further study..."
