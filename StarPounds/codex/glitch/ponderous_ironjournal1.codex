"Feels odd looking at myself in the mirror. Not long ago I was an amazon among Glitch- well tempered iron, towering over the other villagers. Now I'm known for my girth and weight.

Though the added weight has had its benefits: harder for my foes to move me, more padding means less damage, so on.",

"Still, feels odd feeling how far out my belly pushes, how plump my rear is. The envious glances of other Glitch as I pass. It feels pleasant, though I do wish I could go back to my old physique.

Suppose it could just be me being nostalgic- sometimes I wished to be back adventuring alongside Bronzefinger, instead of being burdened with managing the Order. Oh well, such is life.",

"Speaking of, I have noticed something. Sometimes while sparring or training, out of the corner of my visor I can see Bronzefinger staring at me- though just as often she was sheepishly looking away. During lunch and dinner she always insists on bringing me my food.

While I never really put much thought into it (we have been companions for years now), Goldthread seems to think she's flirting with me in her own way.",

"Now I'll admit, I never really considered anything beyond close friends- I haven't really been one for romance. But Bronzie is someone I can make an exception for- we're already quite close, perhaps becoming closer could be on the table...

Maybe I should invite her to my little secret hideaway. Bring some apple cider and a feast just for her~"
