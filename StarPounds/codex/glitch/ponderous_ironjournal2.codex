"Another year, another anniversary for the Order! Feels like yesterday since I ate that lizard and started all this, where does the time go...

Still, I'm not going to complain too much about doing good for the people. The Order's basically universally beloved by the villagers, and more and more keeps have sprouted up in the last few years.",

"In the meantime, Bronzefinger and I have been doing well- despite my worries, we've settled nicely into being 'official'. She definitely seems to appreciate my bulk- constantly snuggling against it and rubbing at my gut. It's becoming tempting to retire from fighting just to stay with her a little more often.

Admittedly, it's becoming tempting to retire and let Bronzefinger stuff me with all the food she has... I'm sure my past self would blow a gasket if she saw my current state.",

"Either way, tonight isn't really a time for me to worry about any duties- our annual feast is tonight! All day the wisps have been dancing in the air excitedly, following the chefs around and watching all the strange new people wander in.

Tonight's a time of merriment, a time to celebrate our deeds and our successes!

... So why do I have this feeling that something bad is coming?",

"I cannot explain it. Somewhere deep within me is overcome with a sense of dread, a sense of some great disaster coming our way. I'm not sure how- we've been having a meteoric rise, we've been consistently successful. Maybe our triumph is too good to be true?...

I think Bronzefinger feels it, though perhaps I'm mistaken. She did peek in my chamber for a minute to check if I'm attending.",

"Maybe it's the stress getting to me. I could use some time to relax, join Bronzefinger down at the banquet hall and let ourselfs indulge in all the roasts and mead and cake we want~

Here's to another year of the Order, and to the years to come!"
