"We were sent here to deal with insurgents. We did not expect spheres of living flame. We couldn't have. And now I remain the last of them.

First was the captain, hit clean in her torso. I could hear the metal in her armor straining to hold her girth in before it abruptly snapped. She was practically the size of a barn by the time they took her.",

"Then there went Silverclasp. He was overpowered by the armored ones. Pulled away to Creators-know-where... And Whitelance, overwhelmed by the roguish ones...

Every attack we made, the ghosts regenerated from. I noticed the white ones muttering some profane prayer.

And soon I noticed one bigger than the rest. She floated in the air, wearing a large hat and ornate robes.",

"She was eyeing me like a beast would eye its prey. I had to run. I had to flee. I hid in a crawlspace. I think one of them hit me. I can feel my body growing. Each step felt heavier as I slinked away.

I write this note as a warning. This place is dangerous. Stay out. Run. Before the wisps claim you. I'll try fleeing as best I can.

This weight... almost feels nice..."
