    "I've got to start writing things down. I'm writing because something terrifies me, I feel like forgetting things. I was arrested by the U.S.C.M for petty thievery, and I was sent to a remote prison. 

That's normal for how any criminal under the U.S.C.M. is treated. But this place has an undeniable strangeness that unnerves me. It's a standard all-woman prison. Yet every prisoner that I see is plump and fat, getting bigger by the day.",

"Some smaller cellmates are scared and paranoid like me, yet the fatter ones seem so complacent. Almost empty-headed. Who's happy to be in prison? It's like their intelligence was sapped, oblivious to what's around them.

I don't care if I'm sounding paranoid. There's something in the food! I know it! I was a thin girl, and never got an ounce of noticeable fat in my life. Yet here I am just a week in, and I can feel my body jiggle as I move around. That's not normal. That's not normal at all!",

"They make us eat a lot of this stuff, more than three meals a day! It was surprisingly good... definitely better than the USCM-issued MRE served in most prisons. But as my waistline grew, and I noticed how fat and growing fatter everyone was, my nerves became wrecked. 

What's worse is how good this stuff is! Addicting, even! Maybe that's why the real fat ones enjoy it so much.",

"Fear is all that consumes me whenever I look upon the faces of those that are really fat. Only wanting to eat more of what they're serving us in larger quantities. At random they also just moo like a mooshi! 

Why are they like this? It has to be the food right? It has to be, I know it's in the food! The food... I can feel my mouth drooling at the thought.",

"I'm not crazy, even with my thoughts mudding up. I couldn't sleep last night, I was so paranoid. I faked being asleep when the lights went out and everyone went to bed. 

I saw some of the staff take one of the prisoners out of her cell, taking her somewhere. The poor girl waddling with a smile on her face. I saw mooshi ears sticking out of her head. They're turning us into farm animals.",

"I think I'm supposed to be updating this journal, but it feels so hard to do, when food is all in my head. My body wobbles when I breath, my belly growling and burbling at the thought of food, and I'm constantly drooling for more. 

When I started to moo when I ate, I remembered this journal. I'm scared to touch what's underneath my hair. I'm scared of how hungry I am. So hungry...",

"^gray;The last written page is stained with drool and milk as the only legible words are 'moo' over and over again.^reset;"
