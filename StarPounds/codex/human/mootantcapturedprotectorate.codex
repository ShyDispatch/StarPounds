    "Usually when the USCM builds military bunkers, or Penal Colonies, they're usually on out of the way hunk of rocks where most people wouldn't find them. So imagine our surprise a Protectorate of all things shows up curious about the lights being turned on.",

"Upon entering the facility there was an engagement, managed to take out two soliders before we were able to knock them unconcious. Now strapped to a table in the lower levels, about to be forcefed that Mooshi stuff.",

"Their belongings included a Protectorate Broadsword that got pretty damaged in the explosion that knocked them out. Their gaudy uniform, some spare pixels. And a Matter Manipulator. I can't believe we have that now. Course the Captain had to snag it, said it'll be better off in Director Palmer's hands."
