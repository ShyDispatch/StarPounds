    "I need a name. I need to know who the hell let a fresh batch of prisoners walk into the prison with weapons and guns. This is not a playground to goof off in, we're dealing with dangerous criminals we have to keep an eye on until we get them all dumb and fat.",

"We managed to lock the gates on both sides of the prison to keep them confined in the center. The bad news is they also have access to the security console that controls the exit doors to this prison. We've effectively in a stalemate until those prisoners starve themselves to death.",

"If we don't solve this situation before the next ship comes in, I don't wanna imagine what the Director will do to us. We were being hired for discretion on her project, just being fired is not in the cards."
