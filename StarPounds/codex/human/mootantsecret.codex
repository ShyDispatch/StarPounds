    "This operation we're doing, it got me wondering. How did Director Palmer come up with the means to alter our very dna to make Mooshi girls? It got me so curious I went back to find as many old USCM records that I could.",

"Director Palmer was part of a special division of scientists, provided with a lot of money and a lot of time for means to expand the USCM's reach. What got her so much cash that she's overflowing with the stuff and wants to continue the project even after the USCM's collapse?",

"It turns out she drew a lot of heads when she stole the dna altering tech the Miniknog used. The same dna altering science that turned them into Apes. Who knows the depths of experiments the Miniknog have done before and after that event.",

"To demonstrate how easy it is to focus on one ideal thing and how applicable it is to anyone, she got the freedom to make these Mooshi girls, and it was probably always about them for the Director. In return when its effects were apparent, she could make the ultimate super soldiers for the USCM. Guess she lucked out in more ways than we'll ever know."
