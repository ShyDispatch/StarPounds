    "Getting this off my chest, this job has creeped me out more than I was expecting. I was a former space marine, I'm used to the antics of the USCM. When some scientist lady is recruiting former members, I figured it'd just be a private military to safeguard dirty secrets she doesn't want out in the open.",

"Yet here I am in a prison complex I'm familiar with, yet not at the same time. I know the underground level isn't standard, nor the strange freezer room of milkshakes the commander is telling us to never drink under any circumstance. We aren't just guarding stuff, we're bringing this place back up to full operations.",

"I'm not even gonna ask where we're getting a new batch of prisoners. But they're given those same milkshakes I mentioned earlier, and despite being debriefed on what was going down. I was still caught off guard when we were turning these people into Mooshi folk. I'll get over it, the pays too good to complain, but I need this feeling to go away so I can get back to work."
