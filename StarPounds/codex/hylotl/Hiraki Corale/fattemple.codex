    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

Seeking to make brave new discoveries, I was curious about tales of a forbidden Goddess of the Avians. Older than Kluex even. And I think I found just the temple to her! The place was seemingly long abandoned. But I knew I was onto something when those crystals that light up other temples were pink instead of red.",

"To my surprise, one statue shined in the darkness, compelling me closer. It was both small and big. I could pick it up in my hands, but the avian was massive (in weight, not size)!

This single, pink statue must've been the spitting image of that old Goddess. I held it close and closed my eyes, lost in thought. It gave me this nice feeling.",

"But when I opened my eyes, I looked down as I felt odd. And my jaw dropped! I was chubby! And growing! I must have awakened an ancient curse!

Naturally I slammed the statue back onto its pedastal and ran out as fast as I could. I was out of breath quicker than normal, and my thighs were chaffing horribly. But aside from my clothing getting tight on me, things didn't get worse."
