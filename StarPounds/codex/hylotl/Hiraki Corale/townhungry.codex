    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer

Recovering from the curse of the fat Avian Goddess statue. I found a pleasant Miniknog village to rest in. For some reason I've been having a terrible hankering for something to sink my teeth into.

Eating much more than I usually would. I must've just forgotten to have breakfast or something. And the food here is quite nice for my palette.",

"When passing a Miniknog store, I grew curious of a shipment being unpacked. The bright shine was enough to make me sneak by and take a peak. What could be so shiny for a normal store?

With the coast clear, I checked an open crate to blindingly bright bananas made of gold! Gold Bananas! Naturally I grabbed as many as I could. The worth of golden bananas could've made me rich.",

"The smell of the bananas was mouth watering though. As soon as I was in the clear, I popped one into my mouth for a taste test. But that taste test turned into emptiness. Before I knew it, I had eaten all those bananas.

How careless of me! I would've gone back for more, but more Apex showed up. Afterwards, I noticed by hips were more flared than usual, while my gut was round and soft. Those must've been some good bananas, because I still wanted more."
