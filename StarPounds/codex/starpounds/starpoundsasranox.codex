    "She just can't see. Esther might not understand the truth, but bringing me to aid her has helped confirm what I've always figured. And I will continue what she will not. Already I've gathered others for the cause. Idiots and bigots who don't grasp it, but useful servants nonetheless.

I can feel we're on the verge of finding the Ruin. Freeing it from its prison. A journey that's filled my stomach with figurative butterflies. After all this time we've found a place that must be what I've sought. A way to free the Ruin.",

"But what I see is more than just a monument to this being, it is for many. Esther's research lead her to a site that focused soley on the Ruin and the Cultivator that sealed it away. Here is a place that lists much more. 

Only the Ruin has Humanity's best interest if it was sealed away. Yet I should not neglect the information before us like she would.",

"At last, so close. What we've learned here is that many of these ancient beings are lost in a slumber. A device here can be used to awaken them all. What other effects this could have is yet to be known. But I put my trust that Humanity will reign supreme over the galaxy.

Regardless of what else may awaken. The Coveted. The Hunger. I'm ready for whatever consequence may happen. A bell to ring for the universe, to wake up even the heaviest dreamer."
