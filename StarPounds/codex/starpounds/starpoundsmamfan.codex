Dear diary: Oh. My. God. I saw her today, in MY town, I swear I'm not lying. Mam, THE Mam, was right there on the street. I was walking out to get my monthly groceries, but lady luck must have been smiling on me because there she was, plain as day in all her wobbling glory.",

"I ran over as fast as my legs could carry, which in hindsight isn't that fast, an aspiring gainer has to make sacrifices! <3 But I guess my luck ran out because she was already surrounded by all those less deserving fans, hogging all her wobbling curves and cute winks for themselves no doubt.",

"I managed to squeeze past all those drooling morons and... there she was, she was so much cuter than she was on tv, or magazines, or all the posters in my room... and then, she looked at ME, right at me! Probably impressed by how pudgy I've gotten in her honor, I would too, I've been making sure to gorge myself on ALL the latest and fattiest foods, just for her...",

"I was thinking all about what I'd say to her, but naturally I was busy looking at those curves and rolls she sports in those tight yoga pants, what a fashion icon! Maybe we could exchange notes about hip plus-sized fashion, or techniques on how to gain just as fast as she does.",

"I was staring RIGHT at her overflowing chest, that shirt must be made of titanium for not tearing, especially at her oh so wobbly gut, I'm more than certain I saw it rumble, so cute!!! Gods... and her ASS, you could get lost in that thing, I'd sure like to... Maybe give it a few kisses...",

"But I realized I was staring at her ass because she was already walking away to the nearby fried food resteraunt... I didn't even get a chance to talk to her!!! or show her all the little tears on my pants from stuffing myself... oh well, I've already made sure to double my grocery list so that when she sees me next, she'll DEFINATELY pay attention. <3"
