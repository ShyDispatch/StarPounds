    "^yellow;//INTRODUCTION^white;

Many a galactic adventurer might know the dangers of being eaten alive by apex predators such as fully mature Poptop adults, the patient Anglure, or the slobbering Oogler

But the most dangerous predators are the ones we may know quite well, those who walk on two legs are as smart as you or I. You never know when someone would leap at you to swallow you whole, or try to cook you in their stew.",

"^yellow;//THROGS^white;

Throgs are the most voracious race of them all. Their entire society is built around eating everything in sight. They can't help it with how hungry they always are, leading them to seeing everything as meals on the menu.

And adventurers are especially tasty to them. The fastest record of a Throg eating a person whole is zero point sixty two seconds.",

"The elasticity of their skin is vast. Capable of swallowing things much larger then themselves, and they can get pretty big already. Naturally fat and yearning to be fatter.

There isn't much that can be done if you meet a Throg. It'd be more surprising to meet a Throg who won't eat you, making them the most likely sapient race to eat you.",

"^yellow;//FLORANS^white;

Florans are another well known species who are capable of eating people whole and regularly do. They even have a problem of eating each other from time to time, just like Throgs.

Widely considered a savage species, Florans simply partake in their hunter life style to the extreme. Always ready to hunt their next meal at a moments notice.",

"Don't be fooled by a Floran with simply a loincloth and a spear. Just because you have armor and a blaster doesn't make you an equal to the fighting prowess of a basic Floran.

Their strength and speed is much higher then other races, and can easily overpower even the most decked out soldier of the future. To give a Floran armor and a blaster...",

"We should all be lucky the tendency to eat others that Throgs and Florans partake in isn't widespead to the other sapient races who roam the galaxy.

But just because it isn't common doesn't mean it's totally impossible. If Throgs and Florans are number one and two, we shall go over the likelihood of being eaten whole by another species."
