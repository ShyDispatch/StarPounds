    "^#8968e2;[SCOUT REPORT #61]^reset;

Once more we've encountered another alien race that we could say barely passes as a sapient creature. Weird three eyed squishies, and not the good kind of squishy.

From what we can gather at a glance they're partially amphibious. Their evolution incomplete and lack important traits for living underwater.",

"Their buildings evokes a primitive species, but their tech is surprisingly more robust despite how they present themselves.

From what we can gather their numbers aren't that numerous, but make up for it by being a dominant force in their quadrant's economy.",

"Gathering more info, they apparently are recovering from a rather poor war with the Florans. A very one sided one that also explains their evolution.

They are a cowardly and unimpressive race, note worth any interest.
