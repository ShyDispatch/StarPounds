    "^#8968e2;[SCOUT REPORT #61]^reset;

Once more we've encountered another alien race that we could say barely passes as a sapient creature. Weird three eyed squishies, and not the good kind of squishy.

From what we can gather at a glance they're partially amphibious. Their evolution incomplete and lack important traits for living underwater, leaving them ugly and useless.",

"Their buildings evokes a primitive species, but their tech is surprisingly more robust despite how they present themselves. As if they are at odds with the primitives they are and trying to be more than that.

Talks with them get us nowhere as their pathetic attempts to communicate puts them on a pedestal they do not deserve. Despite this they are an economic powerhouse in this quadrant.",

"From what we can gather their numbers aren't that numerous,  apparently recovering from a rather poor war with the Florans. A very one sided one that also explains their evolution.

They are a cowardly and unimpressive race, note worth any interest.
