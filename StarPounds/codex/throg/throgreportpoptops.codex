    "^#8968e2;[SCOUT REPORT #43]^reset;

To all Throgs reading this. I must first state a warning about the contents of this report. It may be shocking, revolting, even blasphemous.

While out taking note of various alien creatures and planets suitable for conquest. We came upon a small nugget of a creature the more barely intelligent races have called a Poptop. With such a puny size, we thought it simply another pest to eat.",

"To our surprise, as it approached local prey, we saw it was capable of quite a feat. Its mouth was much larger than anticipated and was able to stretch highly to engulf a creature larger then itself. Truly a sight to make a Throg have hope for the low lives of this galaxy.
Yet we noticed that it was not swallowing its prey. It simply chewed on the creature, a practice we commonly see in all inferior life forms. But this Poptop was... savoring the taste. We waited in utter disbelief, wondering when it would swallow the beast.",

"Then, horror swept over us when we saw it... SPIT out the creature! It was a revolting sight to see such careless eating! What evolutionary dead end lead to such a wasteful lifestyle in these creatures who have the potential to gobble up everything they see?
My scouting party would then wage war with these Poptops whenever we could during the remainder of our expedition. We learned that this was simply a child, as Poptops grow up to be much larger. All the more wasteful of their potential!",

"These Poptops even seemed to share in our hatred. Their eyes scowling at how we eat things whole in great quantities so quickly. Clearly a lost cause. And our technology proved superior to the basic claws and teeth of these plant like lifeforms.

When our Empire comes to this quadrant in full force. We must not forget this discovery. These Poptops must be a high priority to eradicate, we cannot allow such a disgusting way of life to continue.
