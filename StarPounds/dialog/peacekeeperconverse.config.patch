        "I'm glad being a Throg means I'm suspended from the Throg Colonization case out of fear of bias. That's gonna be a mess.",
        "I sure would like to get my OWN desk one day.",
        "Don't let all the travelling get to your weight.",
        "I bring a bad cop vibe to investigations that gives me an edge over the other officers.",
        "Hate having to do investigation cases rather than getting out onto the field like you.",
        "Wonder if they've restocked the donut machine.",
        "Horse masks? Mugs of beer? What is with these weird cosmetics these gangs are using!?",
        "Not really sure why monsters are part of our job, but hey free snacks.",
        "You're Officer <entityname>?! Thought you'd be fatter.",
        "So are other governments funding all this? Paying to house the criminals we lock up? Not sure how else we're getting funding.",
        "All these gangs are somehow organized and not organized at the same time. It's kind of boring.",
        "No, I'm not associated with the Throg empire. You can stop asking."

        "Officer <entityname>? The Captain says you're the one we have to thank for for making all this happen!",
        "Is it just me, or does the Peacekeeper emblem look like a big smiling face? I can't unsee it!",
        "First the USCM, now the Protectorate. What do we even have left?"
