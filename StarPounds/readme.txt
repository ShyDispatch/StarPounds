The main point of interest for this mod is the fat armors. 
Every vanilla race have an armor piece that can be accessed from the weightscale.
Outfit bags will pick out the colors of your character to apply to the armor. Making it friendly to color expanding mods.
Overhauls of the looks for the vanilla races might lead to some clipping or parts of the body not looking quite right. Keep this in mind.
